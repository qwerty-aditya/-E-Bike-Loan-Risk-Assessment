Predicting Non-Payment Probability for Informed Decision Making.

Numerous banks extend loans to customers for the purchase of E-Bikes, and one such financial institution is currently grappling with profitability challenges stemming from a surge in instances of non-payment within their E-Bike financing division. The primary objective of the organization is to evaluate the repayment capabilities of their clients and discern the relative significance of each factor influencing a borrower's likelihood to fulfill their loan obligations.

**Project Objective:**

The primary objective is to predict whether a client will default on their loan repayment. For each unique identifier in the attached dataset (refer to the "ID" column), the task involves forecasting the "Non-Payment" risk level. The goal is to propose an optimal Credit Risk Model using the provided dataset. Any suggested proxy indicators or analyses should assist the bank in identifying potential loan defaulters. Additionally, it is important to define the objective function (evaluation metric) based on intuitive criteria.

**Data Overview:**

- **Column ID:** Identifier
- **Column "Default":** Dependent variable (Y variable) indicating loan default status.
- **Remaining Columns:** Independent variables (X variables) influencing the prediction.

This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the bank's decision-making process and mitigate the risks associated with E-Bike loan non-payment.
